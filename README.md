What?
Book-A-Meal is an application that allows customers to make food orders and helps the food
vendor know what the customers want to eat.

How?
This project is broken down into challenges and completion of all challenges would contribute
greatly to your learning towards becoming a full-stack developer. Upon completion, you would
have built a world-class full-stack (front-end and back-end) Javascript application.

Why?
Andela distributes opportunities. We disseminate Learning and catalyse Technology leadership.
The project is founded on the premise that aspiring Technology Leaders learn programming
whilst building things that matter and that the best way to learn is by building a complete product.
